# Program Your Mind While You Sleep | Dr. Bruce Lipton

- when a person is sleeping at that time, subconscience is in action, conscience is not
	- maybe this is the time, that you can program your subconscience and just modifying this subconscience a bit is the motive
		- but why do I want to modify my subconscience
			- based on the memory of this video, subconscience is always saying negative
				- but is it really true, that's the question?
					- because there's this thing, alright! when am in an examination and am stuck in something which probably needs to be answered by using the memory muscle. 
						- Now, if I just let go off that question, and leave it for the end, magically at the right time, I am provided with the answer
							- subconscience provided the answer to my conscience
								- and yes, subconscience has been built based on experience 
									- this experience, however little(based on the amount of reading, revision etc.) somehow helped me to get the answer at the right time
										- so, a non-modified subconscience just gave me an answer at the right time, which means that another quality of my subconscience is reponsibility
											- These were some of the positive things about my subconscience..
											
- let's talk about the negative impact of the subscience over my thought-process, I am not sure
- Learning a language? Speak it like youâ€™re playing a video game | Marianna Pascal | TEDxPenangRoad - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge7c7otG2mk
- so, the above video talks about how a person learning to use the English language as a tool, becomes a success in terms of narrating the information to other people and receiving exactly the right amount of information from the other person
- This video also said that the speaker is more comfortable with a nonNativeEnglishSpeakerWithProperEnnglishKnowledge than nonNativeEnglishSpeakerWithNONConventionaklnnglishKnowledge 
- Now, this video actually made me attempt to re-evaluate my English language knowledge
- Previously, I was giving speeches, good speeches with clear intonations and clear breakup of the concepts to audience
- never have i ever, tried to look at the audience's face to understand if a particular audience is able to comprehend what I had to say
- most importantly, during questionANswer session, an audience would come up with a question on a topic over which I might have given a good amount of explanation
	- but this person who's part of my audience would ask me the same thing	
		- probably because that person was not paying attention over the concept when I was explaining
			- because the person couldn't comprehend in regards to the speed of my speech delivery
				- or something else
- finally, I probably, have delivered a speech based on my satisfaction which is not in par with the audience's level 
	- I have to also note, that these audience are all big researchers, so I cannot just compare them with people from non-research background
		- there's just one simple rule, my explanation is probably not commprehendable by an absolute beginner
			- probably my speech is uncomprehendableByBeginner because maybe there's something lacking in my own understanding of the absolute basics?
				- maybe I have just taken for what it is, without breaking down the concept into molecular level
					- people say that I do break down things to atomic level
						- maybe that is it, people understands molecular level better than atomic level

- Here's absolute conclusion, which is drawn by me
	- I am better than that EnglishSpeakerWhoIsJustGoodWithTheLanguage and not better that that personWhoIsUsingEnglishAsATool
		- so this personWhoIsUsingEnglishAsATool as somebody who's absolute social?
			- and this thing about social comes to my mind because I have been told that I do not follow exactly what's normal in a particular or a global society
				- Eg: consumerism is absolutely the normal in society, and nonConsumerism is being appreciated when it is coupled with consumerism
					- highly disregarded when nonConsumerism is not coupled with consumerism
						- I would prefer absolute nonConsumerism
							- what is creativity?
								- Creativity is connecting things.
									- things what is being consumed with the things, which is under investigation
										- so question is what is the exact definition of consumerism
											- Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts.
												- let's say google is putting a lot of money on GoLang, in order make it popular
													- people who's using GoLang to be a learning tool, what kind oof consumers are they?
														- they are consumers who is using something to generate money for their own.
															- people using facebook likes for dopamine hits, thereby losing control over what is essential in life, like doing non-dopamine hitting activities
																- or real activiities which is failing to produce dopamine in some kind of people.
- Aninda Maulik definition of consumerism
	- positive and negative consumerism
	
- conscience mind going for a ride, in form of certain connections that it has made to the task on are working on, is it bad?

- Speaker says
	- conscience mind is creative
		- it's driven by wishes and desire
	- I stopped being mindful
		- conscious or aware of something.
			- honeymoon needs to be paid off with real money
	- to talk about what are my true wishes and desires into a recorder
		- and putting that on, while am gonna activate my prime subconscience would seriously help	
			- because 1. subconscience is not my enemy
					  2. subconscience would connect the dots and figure out, maybe the optimal path, which would lead to those desires and wishes
					  3. playing that, just one night, wouldn't work; but I have got to play that over and over every night maybe until the time I start seeing true results
